title: Abstract Acacias (v2.0)
---

An occasionally-updated blog, for any posts I happen to write. (The title is a nod to my long-abandoned LiveJournal.) The first three posts here are pieces I wrote for my [Information Technologies](https://hadro.github.io/info654fa22/) class at [Pratt](http://si.pratt.edu/); later posts might turn out to be anything at all!
